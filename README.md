# flight-ticket-prediction
Machine learning model used to predict the flight charges


# STEPS USED

###### Data Cleaning for Preprocessing Analysis
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Converting object columns to datetime columns
  - Automate our functions for converting and extracting hour, minute, and drop columns
  
###### Handling categorical data and feature encoding
  - Nominal DATA= Data not in any order .Eg name of country Uses one hot encoding
  - Ordinal DATA= Data in some order/Heirarchy EG- god-better-best Uses LaberEncoder
  - Finding the type of flights with highest price
  - creating dummies
  - Decomposing route column
  - Drop Redundant Features
 
###### Outliers in data
 
###### Seperating Independent and Dependent Features
  - Feature Selection
 
###### Applying random forest regressor algorithm 

###### Using Multiple Regression Algorithms to find the best working model

###### Cross Validate the model and Hyper tuning
